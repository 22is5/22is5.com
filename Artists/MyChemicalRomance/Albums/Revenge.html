                >Long ago. Just like the hearse you die to get in again. We are.
                So far from you. Burning on. Just like the match you strike to
                incinerate. The lives of everyone you know. And what's the worst
                you take. From every heart you break. And like the blade you
                stain. Well I've been holding on tonight. What's the worst that
                I can say? Things are better if I stay so long and goodnight.
                And if you carry on this way. Things are better if I stay. So
                long and goodnight. Came a time. When every star falls. Brought
                you to tears again. We are. The very hurt you sold. Can you hear
                me? Are you near me? Can we pretend to leave and then. We'll
                meet again. WHen both our cars collide.</span
