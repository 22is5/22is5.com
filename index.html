            <p>(Or the story that never gets sold)</p>
            <p>The light from the sun</p>
            <p>It is your mother</p>

            <p>This building smelled so familiar</p>
            <p>And I had thought the sense was lost</p>
            <p>And in a daydream I imagined my house</p>
            <p>Where all my father's sense of strength was lost</p>
            <p>And it's all we have</p>
            <p>So find me a place to begin</p>
            <br>
            <p>If I could get this feeling to end</p>
            <p>Trembling idle hands, holding me there</p>
            <p>We laugh in the face of love,<br>because nobody's really there</p>
            <p>Nobody's real</p>
            <br>
            <p>Desire I would try it either way</p>

            <p>The sense of smell that you used all your life</p>
            <p>Well now you know your father lied</p>
            <br>
            <p>I could never find my way without you</p>
            <p>But you're already there</p>
